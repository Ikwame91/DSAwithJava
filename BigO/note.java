//     In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Big O notation is a crucial tool for analyzing the efficiency of algorithms. It describes the upper bound on the amount of resources (usually time or space) an algorithm takes as the input size grows. It helps us compare and choose algorithms based on their performance characteristics.

// Key points about Big O notation:

// Asymptotic Analysis: It focuses on the algorithm's behavior for very large input sizes, not specific small cases.
// Upper Bound: It represents the worst-case scenario for an algorithm, not necessarily the average performance.
// Ignoring Constants: Constant factors and low-order terms are ignored, as they become insignificant for large inputs.
// Common Big O notations and their meanings:

// O(1): Constant time: The resource usage remains constant regardless of the input size.
// O(log n): Logarithmic time: The resource usage grows logarithmically with the input size. Doubling the input size roughly doubles the resource usage.
// O(n): Linear time: The resource usage grows linearly with the input size. Doubling the input size roughly doubles the resource usage.
// O(n log n): Log-linear time: The resource usage grows slightly faster than linearly, but slower than quadratically.
// O(n^2): Quadratic time: The resource usage grows quadratically with the input size. Doubling the input size roughly quadruples the resource usage.
// O(n!): Factorial time: The resource usage grows very rapidly with the input size, making it impractical for large inputs.
// Understanding Big O notation is essential for:

// Comparing algorithms: It allows you to choose algorithms that are efficient for your specific needs and input sizes.
// Predicting performance: You can estimate how long an algorithm will take to run for different input sizes.
// Optimizing algorithms: You can identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in an algorithm.
// : Big O notation is a tool, not an absolute truth. It provides valuable insights, but other factors like implementation details and hardware also influence performance.
